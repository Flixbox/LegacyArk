--- Original Description ---
Deep in rimspace, a science vessel was recently discovered. An ark vault containing thousands upon thousands of tissue samples from earth that was. Now that glitterworld bioengineers have gotten their hands on them, old earth species are once again seeding far off words.

Features
Adds a small number of unique animals to the game. Currently they are mostly domestic harvest moony type animals, though I have plans to expand into other types.

Animals: Angora Rabbit, Highland Cows, Llama, Merino Sheep, Silkie Chicken, Valley Quail.

Up Next
This mod is being merged with a community collaboration project, you can find it here on steam.

Questions?
Q: Is this save friendly?
A: It should be. It might take a bit for animals to show up.

Q: Will you add insert animal here?
A: Who knows, just drop a comment and maybe it will strike my fancy and wind up on my to do list.
